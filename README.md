"Dragon_Repeller" is a JavaScript-based RPG game I developed as part of my Free Code Camp JavaScript course certificate.

The game showcases my proficiency in core JavaScript concepts, including planning the project architecture, object-oriented programming, game logic design, and DOM manipulation.

This RPG project involved careful planning, design, and step-by-step implementation of game logic using JavaScript. 

Starting with initial concepts, I designed reusable functions and object-oriented structures, refining the code through multiple iterations for clarity and efficiency.

I used HTML for structure and CSS for styling, ensuring an engaging visual experience.

Each development phase focused on modular design, optimization, and debugging to refine functionality and user experience. 

After completing the project, I uploaded it to GitHub, maintaining a clear version history to track enhancements and bug fixes. 

This project showcases my  skills in building interactive web applications and demonstrates my ability to take a concept from ideation through to GitHub deployment.
